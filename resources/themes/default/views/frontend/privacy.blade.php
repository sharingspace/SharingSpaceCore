<h6 class="heading-alt">Third Party Collected Information</h6>
<p>We share your information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy statement. We may disclose User Provided and Automatically Collected Information:</p>
<ul>
<li>as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process;</li>

<li>as listed below in this section of the privacy policy</li>
</ul>
<p>We believe in being transparent with the third party tools we use and why we do so. We use the following third party tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google Analytics &#8211; We use Google Analytics to monitor and analyze site usage. This is anonymous data, which means that Google doesn’t have access to any user account information.</li>
<li>Crazy Egg &#8211; We use Crazy Egg to analyze how our users interact with the Service. By analyzing how the Service is used, we can make a better experience. No user data is shared with Crazy Egg.</li>
<li>Freshdesk &#8211; We use Freshdesk, so that users can communicate and ask us questions. Name and email is supplied to Freshdesk when a ticket is submitted by the user.</li>
<li>Social logins &#8211; We allow users to sign up and login to the Service with the following social media services:
<ul>
<li>Facebook &#8211; When signing up or logging in with Facebook, the users name and email is shared with us from their Facebook account. We can never access the users password as a token is passed to authenticate you when logging in. We ask for access to post to a users wall, and they must opt-in when editing their profile.</li>
<li>Twitter &#8211; When signing up or logging in with Twitter, the username is shared with us from the users Twitter account. To be able to best use the Service, the user needs to supply us with their email address manually. When signing in with Twitter, the user grants us access to send tweets. We don’t do this at present and if we were ever to do so, we’d require the user to opt-in first. We do not ask for permissions to send direct messages via Twitter.</li>
<li>Google + &#8211; When signing up or logging in via Google + we request the default permissions. The ability to post to the users account and view their circles is available to us, but not currently used. We would require the user to opt-in first if we ever post on their behalf.</li>
<li>Github &#8211; When signing up or logging in with Github, the username and email is shared with us from their Github account. We cannot access the user’s password as a token is passed to authenticate them when logging in. We never post anything on their behalf to Github.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6 class="heading-alt">Managing Your Information</h6>
<p>We will retain User Provided data from when you use the Service. We will retain and use the data as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. If you’d like us to delete User Provided Data that you have provided via the Service, please contact us at info@anyshare.coop.</p>
<p>We will never sell any personal data for advertising or other purposes.</p>
<p>Sharing Network administrators can see members names and emails when a user joins.</p>
<p>We do not use the Service to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with information without their consent, he or she should contact us at info@anyshare.coop. We will delete such information from our servers within a reasonable time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6 class="heading-alt">Security</h6>
<p>We are concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of our users information. We provide physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect information we process and maintain. For example, we limit access to user information to authorized employees and contractors who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our Service. Please be aware that, although we endeavour to provide reasonable security for information we process and maintain, no security system can prevent all potential security breaches.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6 class="heading-alt">Changes</h6>
<p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. We will notify the user of any changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy here and will inform them via email.
